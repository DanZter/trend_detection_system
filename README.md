# trend_detection_system
Our aim here is to execute a proof of concept that delivers a pipeline that can automatically and regularly ingest relevant data. Then execute pre-defined algorithms which score and identify those entities that begin to get popular in their respective fields. To keep the POC project tractable, we decided to focus on NBA player-related data only.  Their Instagram post-related information was scraped using a well-defined and structured automated selenium browser. Taking NBA-related data is a good idea because we can always swap this with any other time-series data from any field. We intend that this system delivers to help people understand the trends in data and also to identify crucial moments/regions in an entityâ€™s life-cycle data.
